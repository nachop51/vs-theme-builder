## ‚ú® What is it?

Tired of manually editing JSON files to create custom themes for VSCode? Yeah, me too, that's why I created `vs-theme-builder`.

This tool is designed to make theme creation easy, intuitive, and certainly fun. It's as simple as **create a single file** with your theme configuration, choosing **16 colors** of your preference, and the tool will automatically generate the theme for you! You can preview the theme in VSCode and quickly export it for sharing.

## ‚ùî Why you should use it?

Well, if I still haven't convinced you, here are some reasons why you should use it:

- **Simple and Intuitive:** no hassle, no complex configurations, just a few colors and you're good to go.
- **Customization Power:** choose from 16 colors to create a unique theme that fits your style.
- **Boost Productivity:** save time and effort by automating the theme creation process, so you can focus on what really matters, ehem, coding.
- **Awesome Results:** create visually appealing themes that you can share with the world saying "Yeah that's my theme". Cool, huh?

## üì¶ Installation

To install you can use your favorite package manager.

### npm

```sh
npm i -D vs-theme-builder
```

### pnpm

```sh
pnpm add -D vs-theme-builder
```

## üöÄ Example Usage

To start using `vs-theme-builder`, first you need to [install it](#-installation) _(heh)_, and then create your configuration file following up the [documentation](https://vs-theme-builder.nachop.xyz/docs/getting-started/).
After that, you should run the following command to generate the file of your theme:

And additionaly, if you want to publish your theme, refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme#create-a-new-color-theme) to learn how to do it.

That's it! You can now enjoy your custom theme in VSCode.
